# Sorting Visualizer

A simple web-based sorting visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is a tool that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work by animating the process of sorting an array of elements. This project aims to provide a visual understanding of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Shell Sort.

## Features

- **Random Array Generation:** Create a random array of elements for visualization.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize the working of various sorting algorithms.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Step through the sorting process to understand each step.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different paces.
- **Array Size Control:** Change the size of the array for sorting.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the provided buttons to control the visualization:
   - Click "Randomize Array" to generate a new random array.
   - Click on sorting algorithm buttons to start the visualization.
   - Use other control buttons to step forward, step backward, pause, or skip forward/backward.
   - Adjust the speed and array size using the input fields.
   - Click "Change Canvas Size" to adjust the size of the visualization area.
   - Click "Move Controls" to randomly move the control buttons on the page.
